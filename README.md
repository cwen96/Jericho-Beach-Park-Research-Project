# Jericho-Beach-Park-Research-Project

The Jericho Lands is a 21-hectare plot of land located in the West Point Grey neighbourhood of
Vancouver. It is directly upslope of Jericho Park, which itself has significant ecological and
recreational value to the community. 

Jericho Lands is currently planned to undergo redevelopment in the coming years by the Musqueam, Squamish, 
and Tsleil-Waututh First Nations and is currently in the research, planning, and consulting stage. This 
redevelopment could make it possible to restore salmon-spawning streams that once existed in the area.

The aim of this project is to explore the possibility of re-introducing salmon to Jericho Park. The
main objectives of our project are to explore the characteristics of Jericho Park using GIS
software, explore water sources, propose potential locations for possible holding ponds, and
propose possible stream routes for these holding ponds.

Chum were determined to be the best species for reintroduction at the park based on a meeting
that we had with Scott Hinch, an aquatic ecologist at UBC. The criteria for streamflow was
based on the biological needs of salmon. The amount of water needed to sustain a healthy
salmon stream was determined to be 40 L/s or 0.04 m^3/s (1.5 m wide, 0.13 m deep, flowing at
0.20 m/s). This streamflow would be needed from November to the end of April. In other months
(May through October), we set a target streamflow (0.00039 m^3/s to 0.0027 m^3/s) to mitigate
potential evapotranspiration in order to keep the channel wet, but not necessarily flowing.

There are currently two watersheds contributing to Jericho Park, which provide two possibilities
for stream channel locations. The western watershed is 230 ha and eastern is 264 ha. Both
have 62% impervious cover (including roads, roofs, etc). Because of the urban nature of the
system, streamflow is likely to rely on storm sewers and streamflow might be very flashy (i.e.
short floods followed by periods of very low flow).

An analysis of surface water was carried out to estimate potential streamflow. This was done
using water balance equations with weather parameters from 2016, parameters obtained from
literature, municipal databases, and GIS software. Weather data from 2016 was used for water
balance equations.

Stormwater would be the main water source for the stream. However, not all watersheds could
reach the target flow rate (0.04 m^3/s). The average streamflow from November to April would be
0.05 m^3/s in the eastern watershed, which is greater than the target flow rate. Meanwhile, the
western watershed only has average streamflow of 0.024 m^3/s during this period. Holding ponds
could be used to help prevent the flashiness of a stream and store water for use in April, but a
holding pond would have to be enormous (103680 m^3, the size of a football field 19m deep) to
give 0.04 m^3/s of water for one month.

HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems could produce 14 to 46 L/day/1000
ft^2 during the summer. This would be enough, given a reasonable number of newly developed
buildings in Jericho Lands, to mitigate evapotranspiration in the stream channel, and help
mitigate water losses from evaporation and plant uptake in the channel and the existing ponds 
in Jericho Park. However, it would not be of use for the spawning season as there would be no
Chum in the stream throughout the summer.

We have proposed two possible locations of holding ponds as well as the resulting stream that
would be constructed at each possible location shown in Figures 9 and 10, section 3.5. The
holding pond proposed in Figure 9 could be possible with sufficient groundwater pumping,
although dry seasons could be a problem. However, the holding pond proposed in Figure 10
would provide enough water during a dry season due to its water input mainly sourced from the
eastern stormwater catchment.
